# Netflix-Data-Visualization

Below is the interactive netflix data visualization as of Feb 15, 2021. The data is taken from kaggle. The visualization show different details by map, movies and tv shows duration, top 10 directors, ratings, and number of contents added yearly. Also, I had to a calculated field for movies duration to bucket the duration in 5 categories since the original data had movie duration by every minute.
